SET:
Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements
Declared as :
order = set()
NOTE: Defining sets as order = {} will treat order as dictionary not set
Example:
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

# Union
print(set1 | set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Intersection
print(set1 & set2)  # Output: {3}

# Difference
print(set1 - set2)  # Output: {1, 2}

# Symmetric Difference
print(set1 ^ set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
