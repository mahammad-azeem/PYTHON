SET:
Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements
Declared as :
order = set()
NOTE: Defining sets as order = {} will treat order as dictionary not set
Example:
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}


# Union
print(set1 | set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Intersection
print(set1 & set2)  # Output: {3}

# Difference
print(set1 - set2)  # Output: {1, 2}

# Symmetric Difference
print(set1 ^ set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5} #All elements of both sets except the common elements for both sets

#Adding elements
set1.add(7)
print(set1) #Output: {1, 2, 3, 7}

Operators	Notes
key in s	            containment check
key not in s	        non-containment check
s1 == s2	            s1 is equivalent to s2
s1 != s2	            s1 is not equivalent to s2
s1 <= s2	            s1 is subset of s2
s1 < s2	              s1 is proper subset of s2
s1 >= s2	            s1 is superset of s2
s1 > s2	              s1 is proper superset of s2
s1 | s2	              the union of s1 and s2
s1 & s2	              the intersection of s1 and s2
s1 – s2	              the set of elements in s1 but not s2
s1 ˆ s2	              the set of elements in precisely one of s1 or s2
